# P1 - title page
high above the earth two sattelites, GOES-East and GOES-WEST, along with their ride along friend Abi, observe the happenings far below...

# P2
**GW:** Hey GE, are you starting to detect something?

**GE:** I think so GW, bit it's really faint. Let's ask our Abi's

# P3
**GW/GE:** Hey Abi, are you seeing a strong differential response between your Midwave and long wave infra-red channels?

**Abi:** Let me check! Give me a sec, I'm going to try really hard

**Abi:** hHhhhhHHhhhHHhrrrRrrRRrRrRmmmmmmMmMMmMMMMMMMMmMMfffFFFffFFfff

**Abi:** Oh No! there's a fire in Los Angeles!

_science note!_
it's possible to detect and observe fires from space. fire's emit energy in the infra red bands. The Advanced Baseline Immager (our friend Abi) on the GW and GE satelites images the whole planet in the 3.9um and 11 um bands. fires can be detected by subrtacting images of our planet taken in each spectral band

# P4
**GE:** A fire in los angeles?!

**GW:** This is terrible, the timing couldn't be worse

**GE:** Indeed GW, we've been monitoring vegetation health, greenness, soil saturation, moisture, all to study climate change, drought, and fire risk. It's really bad right now and keeps getting worse

# P5
**Abi:** Hey you two, I hate to interup all that talk about all the great things you do to study climate change and the impact of humans on the earth, but there are multiple fires now, and they are spreading!!

# P6
**Abi:** there's a fire aproaching NASA JPL!, it keeps getting closer!

**GE:** OMG!

**GW:** Oh My Sourcecode!

**GE:** So many of our freinds were born there

**GW:** Relatives of mine were developed there

**GE:** They know so much about us, they process our data and do climate science with it, there are no secrets between us!

**GW:** What can we do to help?

# P7
**GE:** We can tell the humans! We can give them the data and they can come up wi the the solutions!

**GW:** Amazing idea GE, it's the perfect partnership! Let's start with data on the extent and intensity of the fires. How fast can we give the humans the data?

# P8
**GE:** Every 10 minutes.

That's right, every 10 minutes several of our kind beam down a full disk image of the earth.

for the first time in human history each person can hold hte whole world in their hands in real time.

There's no excuse anymore, each and every person can watch the whole planet and see what's happening to it.

# P9
**GE:** Look at that GW! The humans are putting out the fires whereveer we see them! There's nothing they can't do when they come together!

# P10
**Abi:** The fires are out!

**GW:** Thank the stars!

**GE:** The humans did so great when they came together just now, but there are so many more prblems to solve.

**GW:** Luckily there are more than 83 of us eath observing sattelietes, with 100's of insttuments, sending down climate data for the humans to use!

**GE:** You could be the human to use that daata to fiugure out what's going on and what to do.

**GW:** or you could buld more of us so we can have more friends

**GE:** And you can have more data!

**GW:** The world looks so beautiful from up here, but it's only you dond there who can save it

# P11
GW-GE-**Abi:**
this is just a small sampling of all we do for the planet. 

We're the eyes of the planet, but you can be it's hands, mind, and heart.

 What a life, i montori vefiataio ncocerage and plant life all day. I wonder that it's like to eat them

random_sat:
 Wow lot's of aerosols over the mountains today, that can't be good

random_sat:
 The winds do be crazy today

random_sat:
 Lot's of cloud cover today

random_sat:
 Yikes! less ice today than this time last year

random_sat:
 there is no air up here, but we can monitor the composition of the atmosphere down there

random_sat: 
 i monitor sea level change;
 sometimes i wish i were a boat;
 i love the oceann so much;
 i'd be a good boat, the best boat
