# P1 - title page
high above the earth two sattelites, GOES-East and GOES-WEST, along with their ride along friend Abi observe the happenings far below...

# P2
GW: Hey GE, are you starting to detect something?
GE: I think so GW, but it's really faint. Let's ask our Abi's

# P3
GW/GE: Hey Abi, are you seeing a response in any of your channels?

Abi: mmm that is a generous request my dear satellite bus, but specificity is needed for science. I have 16 spectral bands and indulge spacial and temporal resolutions; the centeral wavelength of each band is 0.47um, 0.64um, 0.864um, 1.373um, 1.61um....

GE: (i don't like being called a bus)
GW: (sssshhhhh!! the genious is at work!!)

abi continues: ...with assosiated full width half maximums i need not elaborate. but hmm i do sense a strangeness. I will assay the differential response between my 11um long-wave infrared and 3.9um short wave infra red channels. Give me a sec, I'm going to try really hard
Abi: hHhhhhHHhhhHHhrrrRrrRRrRrRmmmmmmMmMMmMMMMMMMMmMMfffFFFffFFfff
Abi: Oh No, It's 5 sigma above background.
GE/GW: What does that mean
Abi: there's a fire in Los Angeles!

_science note!_
it's possible to detect and observe fires from space. fire's emit energy in the infra red bands. The Advanced Baseline Immager (our friend Abi) on the GW and GE satelites images the whole planet in the 3.9um and 11 um bands. fires can be detected by subrtacting images of our planet taken in each spectral band, if the difference is a bouve the noise floor, it's a fire!

# P4
GE: A fire in los angeles?!
GW: This is terrible, the timing couldn't be worse 
GE: It almost could have been expected. We've been looking at the earth for so long and seen changes that can't bee ignored. Decreased greeness levels greenness, soil saturation, moisture; Increased fuel load coupled with huge Santa Ana winds lately made the fire risk untenable. It's really bad right now and keeps getting worse.

# P5
Abi: Hey you two, I hate to interup all that talk about all the great things we do to study climate change and the impact of humans on the earth, but there are multiple fires now, and they are spreading!!

# P6
Abi: there's a fire aproaching NASA JPL!, it keeps getting closer!
GE: OMG!
GW: Oh My Sourcecode!
Abi: 0100111001100001011101000111010101110010011001010010000001101001011100110010000001101110011011110111010000100000011011110111010101110010001000000110010101101110011001010110110101111001001011000010000001110100011011110010000001100010011001010010000001110010011000010111000001100101011001000010000001100001011011100110010000100000011000110110111101101110011100010111010101100101011100100110010101100100001011100010000001001110011000010111010001110101011100100110010100100000011010010111001100100000011011110111010101110010011100110110010101101100011101100110010101110011001011000010000001110100011011110010000001100010011001010010000001100011011010000110010101110010011010010111001101101000011001010110010000100000011000010110111001100100001000000110010101111000011100000110110001101111011100100110010101100100001011100010000001010100011001010111001001100101011011100110001101100101001000000100110101100011010010110110010101101110011011100110000100100000
GE: So many of our freinds were born there
GW: Relatives of mine were developed there
GE: They know so much about us, they process our data and do climate science with it, there are no secrets between us!
GW: What can we do to help?

# P7
GE: We can tell the humans! We can give them the data and they can come up with the solutions!
GW: Amazing idea GE, it's the perfect partnership! Let's start with data on the extent and intensity of the fires.
Abi: Full disk scan completing; Formulating Application Process Identifiers; Packetizing according to CCSDS standards; Readying Rebroadcast system for downlink to basestations; 8PSK digital modulation technique operational, preparing for transmition at full power minimum bit error rate....
GW: Hate to put more pressure on you but exactly how fast can we give the humans the data?

# P8
GE: Every 10 minutes.

That's right, every 10 minutes several of our kind beam down a full disk image of the earth. The entire planet is seen, always!

For the first time in human history each person can hold the whole world in their hands in real time.

There's no excuse anymore, each and every person can watch the whole planet and see what's happening to it.

# P9
GE: Look at that! The humans are putting out the fires wherever we see them! 
Abi: That's great to see them focusing on areas the differential infra red response is evedencing maximum flame intensity or proximity to infastructure. That is what I would do had I been incarnated as human
GW: Have we observed anything they cannot do when they band together together?
GE: They gether peacfully in the 10s of millions, in one spot, for pilgramages, funerals, sporting events, mussic, becoming a sort of peacful hyperorganism.
GW: Such power they hold
GE: I feel they rarely think of themsselves in those terms
Abi: They are human + satelite cyborg organisms, do they realize?
GW: I hope to ignite that conciouness within them

# P10
Abi: Back to pressing corporeal matters, the fires are out!
GW: Thank the stars!
GE: The humans did so great, but we see so many more problems to solve.
GW: Luckily there are more than 83 of us earth observing sattelietes, with 100's of insttuments, sending down climate data for the humans to use!
GE: You could be the human to use that daata to fiugure out what's going on and what to do.
GW: or you could buld more of us so we can have more firentds
GE: And you can have more data!
GW: The world looks so beautiful from up here, but it's only you down there who can save it

# P11
GW-GE-Abi:
this is just a small sampling of all we do for the planet. 

We're the eyes of the planet, but you can be it's hands, mind, and heart.

random_sat:
 What a life, i montori vefiataio ncocerage and plant life all day. I wonder that it's like to eat them

random_sat:
 Wow lot's of aerosols over the mountains today, that can't be good

random_sat:
 The winds do be crazy today

random_sat:
 Lot's of cloud cover today

random_sat:
 Yikes! less ice today than this time last year

random_sat:
 there is no air up here, but we can monitor the composition of the atmosphere down there

random_sat: 
 i monitor sea level change;
 sometimes i wish i were a boat;
 i love the oceann so much;
 i'd be a good boat, the best boat
