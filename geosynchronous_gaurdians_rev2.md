# P1 or title page?
high above the earth two satellites, GOES-East and GOES-WEST, along with their ride along friend Abi observe the happenings far below...

# P2
**GW:** Hey GE, are you starting to detect something?

**GE:** I think so GW, but it's really faint. Let's ask our Abi's

# P3
**GW/GE:** Hey Abi, are you seeing a response in any of your channels?

**Abi:** mmm that is a generous request my dear satellite bus, but specificity is needed for science. I have 16 spectral bands and indulge spacial and temporal resolutions; the centeral wavelength of each band is 0.47um, 0.64um, 0.864um, 1.373um, 1.61um....

**GE:** (i don't like being called a bus)

**GW:** (sssshhhhh!! the genious is at work!!)

**abi continues:** ...with associated full width half maximums i need not elaborate. but hmm i do sense a strangeness. I will assay the differential response between my 11um long-wave infrared and 3.9um short wave infra red channels. Give me a sec, I'm going to try really hard

**Abi:** hHhhhhHHhhhHHhrrrRrrRRrRrRmmmmmmMmMMmMMMMMMMMmMMfffFFFffFFfff

**Abi:** Oh No, it's 5 sigma above background.

**GE/GW:** what does that mean

**Abi:** there's a fire in Los Angeles!

_science note!_
it's possible to detect and observe fires from space. fire's emit energy in the infra red bands. The Advanced Baseline Immager (our friend Abi) on the GW and GE satellites images the whole planet in the 3.9um and 11 um bands. fires can be detected by subrtacting images of our planet taken in each spectral band, if the difference is a bouve the noise floor, it's a fire!

# P4
**GE:** a fire in los angeles?!

**GW:** this is terrible, the timing couldn't be worse 

**GE:** it almost could have been expected. 

**GW:** we've been looking at the earth for so long, I know you have noticed steady decreases in levels of greenness, soil saturation, moisture

**GE:** and you bewail the increased fuel load coupled and the recent Santa Ana winds

**GW:** ya it's really bad right now, the fire risk is untenable. 

# P5
**Abi:** hey you two, I hate to interup all that talk about all the great things we do to study climate change and the impact of humans on the earth, but there are multiple fires now, and they are spreading!!

# P6
**Abi:** there's a fire aproaching NASA JPL!, it keeps getting closer!

**GE:** OMG!

**GW:** Oh My Sourcecode!

**Abi:**

**GE:** so many of our freinds were born there

**GW:** relatives of mine were developed there

**GE:** they know so much about us, they process our data and do climate science with it, there are no secrets between us!

**GW:** what can we do to help?

# P7
**GE:** we can tell the humans! We can give them the data and they can come up with the solutions!

**GW:** amazing idea GE, it's the perfect partnership! Let's start with data on the extent and intensity of the fires.

**Abi:** Full disk scan completing; Formulating Application Process Identifiers; Packetizing according to CCSDS standards; Readying Rebroadcast system for downlink to basestations; 8PSK digital modulation technique operational, preparing for transmition at full power, minimum bit error rate....

**GW:** hate to put more pressure on you but exactly how fast can we give the humans the data?

# P8
**GE:** Every 10 minutes.

That's right, every 10 minutes several of our kind beam down a full disk image of the earth. The entire planet is seen, always!

For the first time in human history each person can hold the whole world in their hands in real time.

There's no excuse anymore, each and every person can watch the whole planet and see what's happening to it.

# P9
**GE:** Look at that! The humans are putting out the fires wherever we see them! 

**Abi:** That's great to see them focusing on areas the differential infra red response is evedencing maximum flame intensity or proximity to infastructure. That is what I would do had I been incarnated as human

**GW:** Have we observed anything they cannot do when they band together together?

**GE:** The scales at which they collaborate are awesome. They gather peacefully sometimes in the 10s of millions, in one spot - for pilgramages, funerals, musical offerings, sporting events - becoming a sort of massive peaceful hyperorganism. They have a system where billions collaborate ad-hoc, this they call the internet.

**GW:** Such power they hold

**GE:** I feel they rarely think of themselves in those terms.

**Abi:** They are also human + satellite cyborg-organisms, do they realize?

**GW:** I hope to ignite that consciousness within them.

# P10
**Abi:** Back to pressing corporeal matters, the fires are out!

**GW:** Thank the stars!

**GE:** The humans did so great, but we see so many more problems to solve.

**GW:** There are more than 83 of us earth observing satellites, with 100's of instruments, sending down climate data for the humans to use!

**GE:** You could be the human to use that data to figure out what's going on and what to do.

**GW:** or you could buld more of us so we can have more friends

**GE:** And you can have more data!

**GW:** The world looks so beautiful from up here, but it's only you down there who can save it

# P11
**GW/GE:**
this is just a small sampling of all we do for the planet. 

**We're the eyes of the planet, but you can be it's hands, mind, and heart.**

**random_sat0:**
 What a life, i monitor vegitation coverage and plant life all day. I wonder that it's like to eat them

**random_sat1:**
 Wow lot's of aerosols over the mountains today, that can't be good

**random_sat2:**
 The winds do be crazy today

**random_sat3:**
Lot's of cloud cover today

**random_sat4:**
Yikes! less ice today than this time last year

**random_sat5:**
 there is no air up here, but we can monitor the composition of the atmosphere down there

**random_sat6:** 

i monitor sea level change

sometimes i wish i were a boat

i love the ocean so much

i'd be a good boat, the best boat
